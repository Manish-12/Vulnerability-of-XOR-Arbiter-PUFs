# Vulnerability-of-XOR-Arbiter-PUFs
Breaking the large XOR-Arbiter-PUFs using Neural Network.

# Objective 

We will predict the final output respnse from k-XOR Arbiter PUFs with n-bit challenge input using keras.

# Dataset Overview

We can access the dataset from <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Physical+Unclonable+Functions">here</a>.

1. 5-XOR_128bit dataset: This dataset is generated using 5-XOR arbiters PUF with 128-bit stages or 128-bit challenge input. It consists of 6 million rows and 129 attributes where the last attribute is the class label or final response (1 or -1). It is divided into two sets: training set (5 million) and testing set (1 million).

2. 6-XOR_64bit dataset: This dataset is generated using 6-XOR arbiters PUFs with 64-bit stages or 64-bit challenge input. It consists of 2.4 million rows and 65 attributes where the last attribute is the class label or final response (1 or -1). It is divided into two sets: training set (2 million) and testing set (400K).
